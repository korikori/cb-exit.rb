# rb-exit
An exit script for Openbox, inspired by CrunchBang's cb-exit, re-implemented in Ruby.
Requires ruby-gtk3; assumes Openbox and systemd, but feel free to modify it for your environment.

If you're also tired of ruby-gtk3 (especially in Arch Linux), take a look at [sh-exit](https://github.com/korikori/sh-exit).
